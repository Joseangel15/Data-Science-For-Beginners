# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be?
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools?
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic?
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work?
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Education      | 5th Graders are falling behind in Math | Test Scores,<br> How many students finish their math homework,<br> Teacher and class of the students | Since the amount of data is not that big, we can store it in an Excel Spreadsheet.<br> If the test scores are calculated online, this info can be automatically organized in a spreadsheet. | Students that complete their homework are performing better in Math<br> The class whit the most failing students and vice-versa<br> The complexity level of the math curriculum
| Vaccination | Older citizens are not getting vaccinated in the state of Delaware | Person's address<br> Person's prefered source of news<br> Person's political affiliation<br> Person's level of education | A big dataset is expected, therefore we will use a SQL database | What kind of information about the vaccine are seniors listening to?<br> What are the geographical areas with the least and most vaccinated seniors<br> | 
| Productivity | Why some Amazon warehouses process packages fasater than others? | Number of packages processed per employee<br> Number of employees per processed packages<br> Amount of hours employees worked each week | The data is stored in the company databases (SQL) | Are some employees overworked (burnout)?<br> Are all warehouses using the same process?<br> Do some warehouses need more employees to handle the extra capacity?  |

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One was able to identify reasonable data sources, ways of storing data and possible decisions/insights for all problem domains | Some of the aspects of the solution are not detailed, data storage is not discussed, at least 2 problem domains are described | Only parts of the data solution are described, only one problem domain is considered.
