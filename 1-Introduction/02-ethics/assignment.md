## Write A Data Ethics Case Study

## Instructions

You've learned about various [Data Ethics Challenges](README.md#2-ethics-challenges) and seen some examples of [Case Studies](README.md#3-case-studies) reflecting data ethics challenges in real-world contexts.

In this assignment, you'll write your own case study reflecting a data ethics challenge from your own experience, or from a relevant real-world context you are familiar with. Just follow these steps:

1. `Pick a Data Ethics Challenge`. Look at [the lesson examples](README.md#2-ethics-challenges) or explore online examples like [the Deon Checklist](https://deon.drivendata.org/examples/) to get inspiration.

2. `Describe a Real World Example`. Think about a situation you have heard of (headlines, research study etc.) or experienced (local community), where this specific challenge occurred. Think about the data ethics questions related to the challenge - and discuss the potential harms or unintended consequences that arise because of this issue. Bonus points: think about potential solutions or processes that may be applied here to help eliminate or mitigate the adverse impact of this challenge.

3. `Provide a Related Resources list`. Share one or more resources (links to an article, a personal blog post or image, online research paper etc.) to prove this was a real-world occurrence. Bonus points: share resources that also showcase the potential harms & consequences from the incident, or highlight positive steps taken to prevent its recurrence.

One or more data ethics challenges are identified. <br/> <br/> The case study clearly describes a real-world incident reflecting that challenge, and highlights undesirable consequences or harms it caused. <br/><br/> There is at least one linked resource to prove this occurred. | One data ethics challenge is identified. <br/><br/> At least one relevant harm or consequence is discussed briefly. <br/><br/> However discussion is limited or lacks proof of real-world occurence. | A data challenge is identified. <br/><br/> However the description or resources do not adequately reflect the challenge or prove it's real-world occurence. |

- Describe a Real World Experience
    - A major health care risk algorithm used patient healthcare spending as a way to calculate health risk and healthcare needs. The algorithm gave the same level of healthiness to black and white patients and concluded that they needed the same level of care. The major flaw is that black patients tend to spend more on healthcare to pay for active interventions like emergency visits to the doctor or hospital. So here we have two populations that spend about the same in healthcare but have very different health needs, therefore the healthcare was being biased.
